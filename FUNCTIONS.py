# funtions;
# 1) built-in functions
# 2) user-defined functions




# we are going to see user defined functions:-->


#this is a simple function to calculate Gmean of two numbers

# def calculateGmean(a, b):
#     Gmean = (a*b)/(a+b)
#     print(Gmean)

# #calling function to complete task
# # calculateGmean(72, 98)




# #we can pass values like this to call a function
# c=28
# d=53
# calculateGmean(c, d)




# 2) function to compare a function
# def compare(a, b):
#     if(a>b):
#         print("a is greater than b")
#     elif (a==b):
#         print("a is equal to b")
#     else:
#         print("a is less than b")

# #calling the function
# g=67
# f=46
# compare(g, f)
# calculateGmean(g, f)


# 3) function to get input from user to creating voter list
# age = int(input("please entre your age here: "))
# country = input("please entre your country here: ")

# def voter(age, country):
#     if(age>=18 and (country=="India" or country=="india")):
#         print("voter is eligible to cast vote.")
#     else:
#         print("voter is not eligible.")

# # calling the function
# voter(age, country)



# note:
# if you want to leave funtion incomplete and want no error for it 
# then use "pass" with proper indentation.

# def percentage(a, b):
#     pass
