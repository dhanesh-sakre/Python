# Tuples
# ========
# a buit-in datatype that lets us create immutable sequence of Value.

tup = (67, 78, 89, 87, 45, 23)

# print(tup)


# ** INDEX:
# ==========
# we can access idx in tuples like  lists.
# print(tup(idx))
# print(tup[0])


# single value tuples:
# =====================
# tup1 = (67,) #comma is important


# methods in tuples:
# ===================

tup5 = (3, 4, 5, 7, 9, 7, 22, 7)

# tuple.index(element)
# print(tup5.index(3))  #returs index value

# tuple.count(element)
# print(tup5.count(7))  #counts total occurance



# # NOTE:
#  tup5[0] = 7     #is not allowed in tuple.
